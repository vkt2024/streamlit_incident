== Summary ==
Table '''wb_terms''' in '''wikidatawiki''' that provides labels and description lookup of entities (but also getting labels and description of entities; works both ways) is being replaced by a set normalized tables we call '''TermStore'''. Part of '''TermStore''', is a class called <code>DatabaseTermIdsResolver</code>, picked up the right host for retrieving wikidata data in client wikis (including '''cawiki''') but didn't use the right db name -<code>wikidatawiki</code>- thus code was trying to get information from wrong database  -<code>cawiki</code>-. [https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/mediawiki/extensions/Wikibase/+/529113/1/client/includes/WikibaseClient.php The patch that fixes the issue] gives more in-depth information on it. It was deployed five hours earlier on client wikis (The patch that enabled it on client wiki is [https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/operations/mediawiki-config/+/527087 527087]) then after caches got invalidated and started to use the new store.

=== Impact ===
Some pages on '''cawiki''' were returning a 500 error due to failing to connect to the database. It potentially impacted all non-wikidata wikis but '''cawiki''' and '''ruwiki''' use wikidata extensively enough for this to cause issues (retrieving property term data is not very commons in client wikis)

=== Detection ===
We got the alert on IRC: <br>
 PROBLEM - MediaWiki exceptions and fatals per minute on graphite1004 is CRITICAL: CRITICAL: 90.00% of data above the critical threshold [50.0]

== Timeline ==

'''All times in UTC.'''

* 11:31 [https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/operations/mediawiki-config/+/527087 the config variable gets deployed]
* 17:26 '''OUTAGE BEGINS'''
* 17:33 Some mw* servers complain about having communication issues to s8 replicas 
* 17:42 Otto runs scap-file again as we were suspecting that a previous revert didn't make it to the intended servers; it didn't work:)
* 17:45 We find out that cawiki (s7) is trying to access the cawiki db on s8 (wikidata) replicas 
* 17:46 We notice that this affects maintly cawiki (catalan wikipedia)
* 17:53 We verify that some pages on cawiki return 500 errors due to database issues
* 18:00 Train gets blocked until this is resolved 
* 18:15 Effie restarts hhvm and php-fpm on app canary servers to rule out any possible cache corruptions (s7 (cawiki) and s8 are off by one); it didn't work:)
* 18:36 Reached out for more help 
* <snip mediwiki internals discussion>
* 18:57 Amir says he knows what it up
* 18:59 Reedy revert's said patch
* 19:15 Jenkins finally merges the patch and Reedy deploys to prod
* 19:17 '''OUTAGE ENDS''' (Voila) 

== Conclusions ==
We don't have proper knowledge of how wikidata works and interacts with wikis. 
=== What went well? ===
* People with Mediawiki knowledge were online and available to help.

=== What went poorly? ===
* We didn't think to look for commits to mediawiki-config further back from before the issue started.

=== Where did we get lucky? ===
* Amir was online and knew exactly to what this was related to.
